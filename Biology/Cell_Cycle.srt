00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The cell cycle is a highly regulated series of events that lead to cell growth and division.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
It is divided into distinct phases: G1 (cell growth), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (preparation for mitosis), and M (mitosis).

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
During the G1 phase, the cell grows and accumulates resources necessary for DNA replication.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
In the S phase, the entire genome is replicated, ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
The G2 phase involves further growth and preparation, where the cell checks for DNA errors before division.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Mitosis, the M phase, is where the cellâ€™s nucleus divides, followed by cytokinesis which splits the cytoplasm.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Cell cycle checkpoints act as quality control, ensuring DNA is replicated correctly and damage is repaired.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Failures in these regulatory checkpoints can lead to uncontrolled cell division and cancer.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Modern research explores cell cycle regulators to develop targeted therapies for cancer and other diseases.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
The study of the cell cycle not only provides insight into cellular function but also underpins many advancements in biomedical science.
