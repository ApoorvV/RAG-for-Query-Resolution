00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The nervous system is a complex network responsible for transmitting signals and coordinating actions in the body.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
It is divided into the central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Neurons, the primary cells of the nervous system, transmit electrical impulses through specialized structures.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Synapses are the junctions where neurons communicate with each other via chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
The brain processes complex information, controlling voluntary actions, emotions, and cognitive functions.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
The spinal cord acts as a conduit, relaying signals between the brain and the rest of the body.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
The PNS includes sensory nerves that transmit external stimuli and motor nerves that control muscle movements.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are crucial for mood regulation and neural communication.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Disorders of the nervous system, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy, impact millions worldwide.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Ongoing research in neuroscience continues to uncover the complexities of neural networks, offering new insights into treatment and rehabilitation.
