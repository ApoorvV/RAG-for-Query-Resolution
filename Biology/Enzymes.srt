00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions essential for life.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
They lower the activation energy required for reactions, making processes efficient and fast.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Each enzyme has a specific active site where it binds to its substrate in a lock-and-key mechanism.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
The enzyme-substrate complex facilitates the conversion of substrates into products through various biochemical reactions.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Enzyme kinetics, including reaction rates and affinity for substrates, are influenced by temperature and pH levels.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Inhibitors can affect enzyme activity; competitive inhibitors block the active site while non-competitive inhibitors bind elsewhere.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Enzymes play vital roles in metabolic pathways, including digestion, energy production, and cellular signaling.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
They are also used in industrial applications such as food processing, biofuel production, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Understanding enzyme function and regulation has led to advances in medicine, including drug development and disease treatment.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Overall, enzymes are critical for sustaining life and driving the biochemical processes that occur in every cell.
