00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the fundamental molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
It is composed of two long strands forming a double helix, a structure first described by Watson and Crick.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
The strands are made up of nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, which pair specifically.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
DNA replication ensures that genetic information is faithfully copied before cell division occurs.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Mutations can occur during replication or due to environmental factors, affecting the sequence and function of genes.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Cells have intricate repair mechanisms to correct errors, maintaining the integrity of the genome.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Gene expression involves transcription of DNA into RNA, which is then translated into proteins that perform cellular functions.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Genetic diversity arises from processes like recombination and mutation, driving evolution and adaptation.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Modern biotechnology uses DNA sequencing and genetic engineering in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and forensic science.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Understanding DNA has revolutionized biology, leading to breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatment, and personalized medicine.
