00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust that allows molten rock, ash, and gases to escape.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Volcanoes are found in tectonically active regions, mainly along the Pacific Ring of Fire.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
There are different types of volcanoes: shield, stratovolcanoes, cinder cone, and caldera volcanoes.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Eruptions can be explosive or effusive, depending on magma composition and pressure buildup.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Volcanic eruptions can cause devastating impacts such as lava flows, ash clouds, and tsunamis.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Volcanic activity plays a role in shaping landscapes and enriching soil with minerals, making it fertile for agriculture.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Some famous volcanoes include Mount Vesuvius, Mount St. Helens, and Mauna Loa.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Monitoring systems help predict eruptions using seismic activity, gas emissions, and ground deformation.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Volcanic islands such as Hawaii were formed due to hot spot volcanic activity.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,000
While dangerous, volcanoes also provide geothermal energy, which is harnessed for electricity in some regions.
