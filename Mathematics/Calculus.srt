00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
It is divided into two main areas: differential calculus and integral calculus.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Differential calculus focuses on rates of change and slopes of curves, using the concept of derivatives.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
A derivative measures how a function's output changes in response to changes in its input.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Integral calculus studies the accumulation of quantities, calculating areas under curves using integrals.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration, showing they are inverse operations.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Calculus has practical applications in physics, economics, engineering, and biology.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Limits are a foundational concept in calculus that define the behavior of functions as they approach specific values.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Understanding calculus allows us to model real-world scenarios like motion, growth, and optimization problems.
