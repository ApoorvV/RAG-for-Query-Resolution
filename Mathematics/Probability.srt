1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Probability is the mathematical study of uncertainty and likelihood.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
It measures the chance of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
The probability of an event is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Basic probability concepts include independent and dependent events, conditional probability, and Bayes' Theorem.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Random variables help in modeling real-world uncertainties, using discrete and continuous probability distributions.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Common probability distributions include the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, each with specific applications.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Probability plays a crucial role in decision-making, statistics, risk assessment, and machine learning.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Bayesian probability helps update beliefs based on new data and is widely used in AI and data science.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Understanding probability is essential for analyzing data, predicting outcomes, and improving strategic planning.
