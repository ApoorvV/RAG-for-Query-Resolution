Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and the properties of space.

It includes the study of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

Euclidean geometry, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, forms the basis of classical geometry.

Triangles are one of the fundamental shapes studied in geometry, classified as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Circles have unique properties such as radius, diameter, circumference, and area, governed by formulas involving Ï€.

3D geometry studies shapes like spheres, cylinders, cubes, and pyramids, extending 2D principles into three-dimensional space.

Transformations in geometry, such as translation, rotation, reflection, and dilation, describe how shapes change in space.

Geometry has real-world applications in architecture, navigation, art, engineering, and computer graphics.
