00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and the properties of space.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
It includes the study of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Euclidean geometry, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, forms the basis of classical geometry.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Triangles are one of the fundamental shapes studied in geometry, classified as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Circles have unique properties such as radius, diameter, circumference, and area, governed by formulas involving Ï€.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,000
3D geometry studies shapes like spheres, cylinders, cubes, and pyramids, extending 2D principles into three-dimensional space.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Transformations in geometry, such as translation, rotation, reflection, and dilation, describe how shapes change in space.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Geometry has real-world applications in architecture, navigation, art, engineering, and computer graphics.
